👨‍💻 I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Florida.

🥷 Proficient in software engineering, Machine Learning, and harnessing cloud technology to address practical challenges effectively.

👨‍🏫 I engage in diverse projects aimed at enhancing web applications, Machine Learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques. I am constantly working on new projects, which can be viewed in the projects section of my portfolio website. I continuously hone my skills in software engineering, with a focus on backend development, database design, and cloud computing, to advance proficiency in these domains for practical application.

## 👨‍🎓 Educational Background and Current Aspirations

I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Florida. Prior to commencing my master’s degree, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Osmania University in 2020. I am looking for full-time Software Engineer, Full-Stack Engineer, or Backend Engineer positions.

## 👔 Professional Exprience

During my tenure at Delhivery Ltd. in Hyderabad, India, I played a pivotal role in developing and implementing billing APIs, managing over $1.3 million in monthly transactions, and crafting vehicle attendance and contract management APIs for the company's logistics operations. Additionally, I spearheaded the integration of FMS and Orion platforms to optimize vehicle procurement processes, resulting in the successful launch of the Transporter Service Application as a Docker microservice. My initiatives during peak Diwali traffic significantly enhanced API performance, reducing response times by over 50% and substantially cutting infrastructure costs. Furthermore, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to adapt software for Volvo vehicles, facilitating a new inter-city goods transport method that boosted profitability and operational efficiency. As a Software Developer Intern, I enhanced data caching mechanisms, reducing application downtime by 50%, and developed a digital dispute system that resolved billing discrepancies for vendors, streamlining financial processes.

## 💼 Student Assistant Experience

As a student assistant for CNT5517/CIS4930 (Mobile Computing), I supervised a class of 62 students, overseeing exam proctoring, leading weekly labs, and managing the online discussion forum. Collaborating closely with the instructor, I contributed to assignment design and grading processes. Additionally, I conducted Raspberry Pi help sessions, offering technical guidance that resulted in all students achieving top scores on related assignments. Moreover, I facilitated seamless progress by addressing bugs in the pre-built software system used for lab assignments, ensuring adherence to the course timeline.
