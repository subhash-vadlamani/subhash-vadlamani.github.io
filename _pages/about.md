👨‍💻 I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida.

🥷 Proficient in software engineering, Machine Learning, and harnessing cloud technology to address practical challenges effectively.

👨‍🏫 Engaged in diverse projects aimed at enhancing web applications, Machine Learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques, while concurrently providing support to students in both graduate and undergraduate levels, particularly in the mobile computing course. Continuously honing skills in software engineering, with a focus on backend development, database design, and cloud computing, to advance proficiency in these domains for practical application.

## 👨‍🎓 Educational Background
As a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, I will be graduating in May 2024. Prior to commencing my master's degree, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Osmania University in 2020.

## 👔 Professional Exprience
During my tenure at Delhivery Ltd. in Hyderabad, India, I played a pivotal role in developing and implementing billing APIs, managing over $1.3 million in monthly transactions, and crafting vehicle attendance and contract management APIs for the company's logistics operations. Additionally, I spearheaded the integration of FMS and Orion platforms to optimize vehicle procurement processes, resulting in the successful launch of the Transporter Service Application as a Docker microservice. My initiatives during peak Diwali traffic significantly enhanced API performance, reducing response times by over 50% and substantially cutting infrastructure costs. Furthermore, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to adapt software for Volvo vehicles, facilitating a new inter-city goods transport method that boosted profitability and operational efficiency. As a Software Developer Intern, I enhanced data caching mechanisms, reducing application downtime by 50%, and developed a digital dispute system that resolved billing discrepancies for vendors, streamlining financial processes.

## 💼 Student Assistant Experience
As a student assistant for CNT5517/CIS4930 (Mobile Computing), I supervised a class of 62 students, overseeing exam proctoring, leading weekly labs, and managing the online discussion forum. Collaborating closely with the instructor, I contributed to assignment design and grading processes. Additionally, I conducted Raspberry Pi help sessions, offering technical guidance that resulted in all students achieving top scores on related assignments. Moreover, I facilitated seamless progress by addressing bugs in the pre-built software system used for lab assignments, ensuring adherence to the course timeline.
