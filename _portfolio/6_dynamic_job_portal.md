This project is a dynamic job portal developed using React. It enables users to manage job postings effectively, supporting operations such as viewing, editing, and deleting jobs.

**Project Overview:**
- **Advanced Routing**: Uses React Router for navigating between different components and pages, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **React Hooks**: Implements hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects locally within components, which makes the application more responsive and performant.
- **Interactive User Interface**: The application includes a user-friendly interface with components like a navigation bar, job listings, and editable job forms, making it easy for users to interact with the portal.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, allowing users to add new jobs, view job details, edit existing jobs, and delete jobs as needed.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the job portal is accessible and functional on various devices and screen sizes.

This job portal not only provides a practical tool for job management but also serves as a showcase of modern React development practices and user interface design.
