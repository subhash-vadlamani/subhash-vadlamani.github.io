permalink: /publication/1_liver_disease_detection
excerpt: 'Liver diseases are a significant global health concern. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project developed a full-stack web application integrated with machine learning models to detect liver disease early. We used the UCI ILPD dataset and applied genetic algorithms and other optimization techniques to identify key predictive features. This approach enhanced model accuracy significantly, offering a valuable tool in medical diagnostics.'

**Project Overview:**
-    **Feature Selection Using Genetic Algorithms**: Identified crucial features that significantly impact liver disease prediction, enhancing the predictive models' accuracy.
-    **Machine Learning Integration**: ntegrated the selected features into various machine learning models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, further refining the accuracy of liver disease predictions.
-    **Full Stack Web Application**: Developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, which serves as an interface for the predictive models. The application includes multiple pages such as Sign Up, Login, Profile, Prediction Form, and a Landing Page, providing a comprehensive tool for both medical professionals and patients.


**Technical Architecture:**
-   Our methods achieved high accuracy in detecting liver disease, making the tool a valuable adjunct in medical diagnostics.
-   Employed a layered architecture approach, facilitating maintenance and scalability.

**Results:**
-   The application architecture supports robust data handling and model deployment, ensuring reliable predictions and a seamless user experience.
-   The findings and methodologies were well-received in the medical community, as detailed in our publication in the 'Annals of the Romanian Society for Cell Biology'.
